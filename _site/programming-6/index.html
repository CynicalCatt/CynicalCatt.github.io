                        <p>I half regret saying Bootstrap was easy.</p>

<p>Working on the image gallery exercise was a bit like trudging through hell. I attempted to do it on my own, but quickly came across multiple problems. Which, as it turns out, was a result of not knowing about the thumbnail component.</p>

<p>Even after solving that and mostly following along with the solutions video, I came across <em>another</em> problem: My <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons">glyphicons</a> weren‚Äôt displaying. After a few hours, I determined that I was linking to my downloaded Bootstrap file wrong‚Ä¶ and instead of spending a few hours sorting that out, I decided to play it safe and use the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">Bootstrap CDN</a> provided. Then it <em>finally</em> worked!</p>

<p><strong>I wish the image gallery exercise was actually a reverse engineering exercise.</strong> Give us the important details, maybe hint at thumbnails, then leave us to struggle until we give up. I mean, I guess I <em>could</em> have reverse engineered it anyway ‚Äì I did <em>try</em> ‚Äì but there were a lot of small details (e.g. How do the images react when shrinking the window size?) that were only revealed as the solution was explained, making it difficult to complete without ‚Äúspoiling‚Äù myself.</p>

<p>Or maybe I just need to research more. Eh.</p>

<p>However, all the experimentation did make the second task ‚Äì a landing page ‚Äì surprisingly easy. I had to rely on the solutions for some parts, like the text shadows, but for the most part I was able to figure it out on my own! I think I‚Äôm very slowly getting a hang of everything! üôÇ</p>

<p><strong>Now onto JavaScript.</strong></p>

<p>I tried learning it in the past. Picked up two books, went around 100 pages into them, then gave up because I knew the basic concepts but just couldn‚Äôt seem to apply them to anything.</p>

<p>Basic JavaScript is easy if you‚Äôve ever learned any <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-languages-are-front-end-and-which-ones-are-back-end">backend language</a> before. The general concepts are similar ‚Äì variables, strings, numbers, loops, booleans, etc. In my case, I picked up Python and JavaScript basics quite a while ago, so it was just revision. The only thing new was learning about the JavaScript console on Chrome. Breezed through the exercises in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>But I have no doubt that the difficulty will eventually ramp up.</p>

<p>Looking forward to that!</p>
