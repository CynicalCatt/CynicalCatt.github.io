# Personal Blog

Link to project page: https://cynicalcatt.github.io/

Personal blog for all my endeavors. Created through Jekyll. Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla, jQuery), Bootstrap.

Eventually will turn into a full portfolio website.

**Note:** I plan on implementing additional features and revamping the entire website eventually. Some of my ideas include:
- Adding a projects page.
- Adding "About" and "Contact" pages.
- Using a Photoshop template to revamp layout into something more stylish.
- Fixing mobile view.
- Removing scrollbars.
