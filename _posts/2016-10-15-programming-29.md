Finally, finally, *finally* learning about the backend! I feel like I’ve been working for so long to get to this stage. 🙂

Started off by solidifying my knowledge on [how the Internet works](http://www.explainthatstuff.com/internet.html), as well as the difference between [static and dynamic pages](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Static-Websites-and-Dynamic-Websites). I also learned that “stack” referred to all the technologies used to create, say, a website. [This website](http://stackshare.io/stacks) aptly shows what I mean by technologies.

I only had 30 minutes to study, so I ended my study session after learning about the nitty gritty of HTTP requests. To summarize what I learned:

* “Get” requests literally just get the data. You don’t actually send any data. So, clicking on a link to go to a specific page. Important to note that any request made from the browser search bar is always a “get” request.
* You do send data with “post” requests. For example, filling in a form and submitting it.
* “Put” and “patch” requests are used to update or edit things.
* Status codes! Now I understand why a page that fails to load is called 404.

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) helped a lot in analyzing HTTP requests further. Highly recommend it.

Seems like there’s several more videos of backend logic to work through before I can actually get to writing any code. A bit annoying, but I know the logic will come in useful, so I’ll do my best to burn it into my brain.

Till tomorrow!
