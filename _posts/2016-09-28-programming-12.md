Happy to announce that I officially passed [Gengoâ€™s](https://gengo.com/) preliminary J->E translation test! I donâ€™t expect to make a bunch of big bucks working for them, but Iâ€™d like to make a little cash here and there when the translation bug hits me. Still have to pass the standard translation test to start getting work, but Iâ€™m excited to begin! ðŸ™‚

Also sent off an email to a recruiting agency that has dealt with international students before. The search to find a full-time job is getting serious!

Continuing from my last post â€“ the DOM!

Learned about a few methods for the document. Most of them are self-explanatory, but it was interesting to hear about the difference between [arrays and node lists](http://www.nfriedly.com/techblog/2009/06/advanced-javascript-objects-arrays-and-array-like-objects/). The syntax is certainly a bit longer, but so far, it seems to be easy enough to select certain elements of a page through methods.

Also learned a bit about how to manipulate certain style properties of document objects using [class lists](http://mdn.beonex.com/en/DOM/element.classList.html). Little bit difficult to get a hold of, but I think itâ€™ll get easier to understand with time and practice.

At first, I was confused about why youâ€™d need to manipulate their styles when thereâ€™s CSS. However, now I realize itâ€™s *useful* to be able to do so using JavaScript if youâ€™re planning on having a dynamic web page.

Going to keep todayâ€™s study session short as well because I spent most of the day studying Japanese and prepping for a test on Friday. But so far, Iâ€™m almost done with basic DOM manipulation. Thereâ€™s only one more section on it, then itâ€™s onto jQuery!

Iâ€™m ridiculously surprised that in less than a week, Iâ€™ve gotten further than I ever have before. Iâ€™ll work hard to keep this pace up! ðŸ™‚
