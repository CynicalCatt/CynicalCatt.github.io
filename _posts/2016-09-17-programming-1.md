Sick and tired of constantly procrastinating from my studies. So I decided to pay some real cash for [Colt Steeleâ€™s The Web Developerâ€™s Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy. Rated highly, well-reviewed even on Reddit, so it should go well.

I dabbled in HTML and CSS when I was younger (thanks [Neopets](http://www.neopets.com/)!), so the first three sections went by in a flash. Only things I really took note of was the slight change in element names that came with the introduction of HTML 5. Oh, and the shortcuts that [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) provided.

Sublime really reminds me of how things have changed. Used to be that youâ€™d have to type everything out. Nothing was colored either. Now code is easier to read than ever before and shortcuts save you from tired fingers. I love it! ðŸ™‚

In my opinion, if youâ€™ve at least dabbled in HTML in the past, the web page recreation assignments for the first three sections should be a piece of cake. As in, youâ€™ll literally finish in less than five minutesâ€¦ depending on your shortcut usage and general typing speed.

Have part-time work the next day and a Japanese quiz I need to study for, but Iâ€™m looking forward to tackling CSS during my next study session.
