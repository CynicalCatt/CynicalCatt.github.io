Today I did work a little bit more, but I’m feeling ridiculously tired, both physically and mentally. So I decided to give today a rest.

What I can tell you is that I got the basic functionality working with random colors. Now I need to figure out how to give it an “easy” setting, along with a replay button and some other stuff.

Also, functions inside of functions are surprisingly difficult to read. But I guess that’s what comments are for, eh?

G’night.
