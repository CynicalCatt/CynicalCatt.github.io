title: Programming Session 30

Worked through a few more videos on backend logic. Nothing overly difficult. Very logical, actually.

Then moved on to setting up [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), which is [a cloud-based IDE](http://mashable.com/2010/10/06/ide-guide/#aDIbLGQJGkqb).

**Incidentally, this is where I stumbled across a small… *problem*.** Back when Cole Steele created the course, Cloud9 didn’t require credit card details for free user verification. However, now they do. While I can (and *did*) use my parent’s details to solve this issue, I wish such a step wasn’t necessary. [Countless others agree.](https://community.c9.io/t/credit-card-required-for-free-account/7434)

Though I decided to continue with Cloud9 anyway, I would suggest for those more experienced in IDEs (*and that don’t need the solutions for Cole Steele’s course!*) to go with another service. [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) seems to be a similar service that’s also highly rated. And [Nitrous](https://www.nitrous.io/) seems to get mentioned a lot within the programming community… though I have no idea if it provides all the features that Cloud9 has.

I’ve never used an IDE before. Most of the basic features, like the text editor and file tree, were easy enough to “get” because I’ve used them before. However, the [terminal](http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it) (otherwise known as the *command line*) was like an alien object. Pretty sure I used it before, but I never actually learned what it was, how it worked, its full potential, etc. Luckily, this course teaches me the basics. 🙂

To summarize what I learned (*knowledge of JavaScript terminology helps*):

* “ls” just tells you which folder you’re currently on.
* “ls [folder name]” tells you what’s inside whatever folder you named.
* “cd [folder name]” lets you navigate to a “child” folder.
* “cd ..” brings you back to the “parent” folder.
* “touch [file name]” creates a file for you!
* “mkdir [folder name]” creates a folder for you.
* “rm [file name]” deletes a file for you!
* “rm -rf [folder name]” deletes the folder you named, along with everything inside the folder.
* Press the up arrow key to go back to something that you previously typed. Helps save time when typing the same thing!
* You can create multiple files (or folders) at once by adding spaces. For example, “touch fileA.html fileB.css fileC.js”.


Then moved on to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)! Long story short, allows people to use JavaScript to create backend stuff.

I only had a short amount of time to learn before heading to bed, so I just ran through the basics. For example, how to open the Node console from the terminal. Or how to run a file on Node. Then did a quick exercise to test my skills, which I aced! 🙂

Tomorrow’s another day of learning! G’night!
