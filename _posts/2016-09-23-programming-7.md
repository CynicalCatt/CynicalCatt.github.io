Back to JavaScript basics!

I said in my last post that I studied up on the basics before. Multiple times. Even so, I learn new things about them every day. For example, I had no idea that == and === were [different](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19915688/what-exactly-is-type-coercion-in-javascript)! Learning about [truthy and falsy values](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/) was also fascinating. Not sure when Iâ€™ll be using these values, but if theyâ€™re being taught, I suspect theyâ€™ll eventually pop up.

**Going through the basics reaffirmed how shit I am at math.** For example, it took a year of private morning classes with my homeroom teacher before I was able to master basic arithmetic â€“ at *Grade 6*. Another example is how I wouldâ€™ve entered Medicine (*I had stellar grades*) or Computer Science if my math marks werenâ€™t so bad. I also canâ€™t remember family membersâ€™ birthdays, PIN codes, address codes, *my own phone number*, etc.

However, if that hasnâ€™t stopped other people, it wonâ€™t stop me!

Got through two sections today. Finally watched the 100th video in the course (out of 309) and Iâ€™m looking forward to continuing this streak in the distant future. ðŸ™‚

On a non-programming-related note, I decided to relax a bit today and watch [Days](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32494/Days_TV), the anime. What startled me was how little I needed to rely on the subtitles. Iâ€™m slowly, but surely, making progress with Japanese!
