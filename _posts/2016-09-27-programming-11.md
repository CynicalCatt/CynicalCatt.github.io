A common myth is that [it takes 21 days to create a habit](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/forming-new-habits_b_5104807.html). This has already been debunked by science, but my current goal is to study (and post!) every day for **21 days in a row**.

Had classes in the morning and spent some time laughing at the [2016 USA Presidential Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuHuzhzb1nc), so I got to my programming studies quite late today. Ah well. Itâ€™s what you make of it that counts, eh?

Creating arrays with nested objects and using array iteration on them helped me learn a **key lesson**: In your array iteration, thereâ€™s no *need* to specify the objectâ€™s position when retrieving data from it, because the iteration automatically delves into the array for you. This is what I mean:

{% highlight javascript %}
var movies = [
	{title: "Frozen", rating: 5, hasWatched: true},
	{title: "Presidential Debate 2016", rating: 2, hasWatched: true},
	{title: "The Matrix", rating: 3, hasWatched: false}
];
movies.forEach(function(movie) {
	if (movie.hasWatched !== true) {   //NOTE HOW IT ISN'T MOVIES[MOVIE].XXXX
		console.log("You have not watched " + movie.title + " - " + movie.rating + " stars.");
	}
	else {
		console.log("You have watched " + movie.title + " - " + movie.rating + " stars.");
	}
})
{% endhighlight %}

Methods are confusing to write and read. In fact, I have a feeling objects in general will be difficult to read if they have multiple nested properties or methods. But I can see the advantage in using them, I guess. When you get used to them, they can really help in organizing data.

Also learned about the key word *this*, but there were no exercises on it, so I havenâ€™t fully absorbed it yet. Itâ€™s something that will be handled later in the course, I guess.

**With this, JavaScript basics are officially finished!** ðŸ™‚

Before going to bed, I spent some time learning a bit about the DOM. Specifically, selecting and manipulating document objects. I actually studied briefly on the concept many years ago, but back then, I didnâ€™t know what it was called. To me, it was just a random fact. Now that I know itâ€™s a vital part of creating awesome websites, Iâ€™m hyped up to learn more!
