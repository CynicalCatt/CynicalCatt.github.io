Beginnerâ€™s CSS isâ€¦ easy. Not sure if itâ€™s because I did it before or rather, if itâ€™s because CSS syntax is often self-explanatory. Even specificity was easy to get without the long-winded explanation, because itâ€™s justâ€¦ logical. Learning about the Chrome Inspector was interesting though. Dabbled in it before, out of curiosity, but it was my first time actually learning about it.

The selectors practice exercise, however, was a bit difficult. Everything went easy as pie up until I had to use the nth-of-type selector. Didnâ€™t really understand it in the video explanation and [the website provided](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) didnâ€™t help much either. Found a probable answer on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30256644/how-to-select-a-only-a-paticular-p-tag-inside-div-tag-hierarchically), so stuck that in with a few modificationsâ€¦ and luckily, it worked. Then the solutions video cleared it all up. Thanks Cole Steele! ðŸ™‚

For those that still donâ€™t get it:

- **div:nth-of-type(3)** == Pick the 3rd div.
- **div:nth-of-type(3) p:nth-of-type(2)** == Pick the 3rd div, then pick the 2nd paragraph in that div.

Ended todayâ€™s session halfway through Section 6. Next upâ€™s the [Box Model](https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/55fba7ade2ae0be15df2b309/56c13fd6bf6d3281049d04ae_box-model.gif), which I remember to be surprisingly difficult several years prior, so letâ€™s see if Colt Steele has managed to explain it in a better wayâ€¦
