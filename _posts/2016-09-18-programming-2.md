Started off where I last left off: Tables and forms.

Tables were easy enough. Did them before, tags are mostly self-explanatory, so I could do them again. Had to get a bit used to the HTML 5 way of laying out tables, but otherwise it went swimmingly.

Forms, however, was a bit of a pain in the arse. Never did them before, so it was all new content. In my opinion, Colt Steele also rushed through it quite a bit, with no exercises in-between explaining the bits and pieces of a form before getting into a full-blown ‚Äúrecreate this form‚Äù exercise. But maybe I just have a short attention span‚Ä¶

Then onto CSS! The way to make websites beautiful. üôÇ

**I love the changes that CSS has gone through over the years.** I was there for the early versions of CSS, where you had to style everything within an element because separate style sheets just didn‚Äôt exist. Painful work.

What‚Äôs sad is that in-line styling is still used today! I had to work on a newsletter for a volunteer organisation a while back and I was shocked by how the code input box wouldn‚Äôt allow separate style sheets, forcing the newsletter creators to style everything in-line. Going through the code just to change a few lines and re-position a few things was an absolute nightmare!

I have a feeling that the CSS sections will go a lot more slowly than HTML, since I haven‚Äôt had much practice with it. But I‚Äôm looking forward to it!
