jQuery! 🙂

I won’t lie, I’ve been excited about this unit for a long time. jQuery is extremely popular and many companies demand it, so being able to use it is a boon. Plus it makes selecting and manipulating objects in the DOM a heck lot more easier.

One quick thing that I affirmed was that links to libraries must always come before the JavaScript file link. Otherwise they won’t work. This was a source of irritation back when I was first learning Bootstrap, since there was no mention of this “rule”. Having it cleared out is a huge relief.

After learning about selecting and manipulating the DOM using “[Vanilla JavaScript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs)” (coders will get the joke), jQuery is surprisingly easy to understand and learn. Basically breezed through the entire section.

Since I didn’t actually have much time today, I ended the study session before getting to the meaty to-do list exercises. That’ll be saved for tomorrow.

Night y’all!
