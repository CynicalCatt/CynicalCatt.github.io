title: Programming Session 8
---
 
Started learning quite late today. Had work on the morning, then chilled back with some [Days (anime)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32494/Days_TV). Which, by the way, went exactly like I expectedâ€¦ but was still awesome nonetheless. My heart pains for Seiseki! ðŸ˜¦

Today I began learning about functions. Did it before, so nothing new, just revision. I did, however, finally learn about [the difference between console.log() and return](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21020608/difference-between-console-log-and-return-in-javascript). Iâ€™ve been taught it several times, but I never seemed to get it. The explanation was too vague, peppered with too many technical terms, or just plain not there. Cole Steeleâ€™s method of dedicating a video to actually *show* the difference finally got it through my thick skull. Thank you, Cole Steele! ðŸ™‚

That said, the functions problem set wasnâ€™t easy. I was able to create a function that asked for a number and determined if it was even quite easily:

{% highlight javascript %}
function isEven(number) {
	var number = prompt("Enter a number!");
	if (number % 2 === 0) {
		return "True";
	}
	else {
		return "False"
	}
}

isEven()
{% endhighlight %}

And with [a bit of research](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144783/replacing-all-occurrences-of-a-string-in-javascript), I was easily able to turn a kebab string into a snake string:

{% highlight javascript %}
function kebabToSnake(string) {
	return string.replace(/-/g, "_");
}

kebabToSnake()
{% endhighlight %}

But because of my shitty math skills, I was unable to figure out how to find the factorial of an inputted number on my own. In the end, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4438131/factorial-of-a-number) saved my butt, but it took going through the solutions video to really make sense of the answer. I also learned about the [*= operator](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_operators.htm).

I know Iâ€™m still learning, so itâ€™s not expected for me to get these right. But itâ€™s still frustrating nonetheless. Iâ€™m still going to power through anyway. Practice and constant learning will eventually make close to perfect.

Functions are crucial for any and all programming languages, so I spent a lot of time today trying to understand them in their entirety. Went through scopes (again, revision) and higher order functions. Learnt about [anonymous functions](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_definition.asp), but find them annoying to read and type. Hopefully I donâ€™t have to use them a lotâ€¦

Next up is arrays! Another topic that I donâ€™t particularly like, but have to do well at. Hopefully all goes well.
