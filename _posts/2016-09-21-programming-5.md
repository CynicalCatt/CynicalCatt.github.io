title: Programming Session 5

Onto Bootstrap! I have the rest of the week “off” (still have part-time work) so I can dedicate more time towards my studies!🙂

**Bootstrap is incredibly easy to use.** To summarize, all you have to do is [reference the bootstrap.css file](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) in your HTML, then apply the premade CSS available in the file using classes. If you want to change how the CSS looks, you can change the original bootstrap.css file. Simple and *amazing*!

The [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) is a particular piece of genius that I think I’m going to love when creating my own website. Basically a better version of the <table>. Going to take a while to get used to though.

Today I’m unusually tired, so I cut my programming session short. Hopefully I’ll be fired up by tomorrow.
