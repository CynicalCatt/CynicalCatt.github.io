Two whole weeks of daily studying have passed! Seems like just yesterday when I started with a hazy memory of HTML and CSS. Now I‚Äôm actually onto JavaScript and making interactive web pages!

Started off today by finishing off the scorekeeper exercise. After a good night‚Äôs sleep, I was easily able to finish off most of it by myself. One thing I wanted to work on was getting the input field to clear after pressing the reset button. I tried [the methods described here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15343890/clear-input-fields-on-form-submit), but neither of them worked. Entering an empty string made it impossible to raise the score-keeping limit past 1. But that‚Äôs a ‚Äúbug‚Äù that I‚Äôll look at when I‚Äôve gotten a bit better at JavaScript. For now, I want to keep chugging away!

Afterwards, I started the color game exercise, which is the first big exercise in the course. Having spent so long in JavaScript, I forgot some HTML and CSS basics. Luckily, Google has the answer to everything. Ended today with the basic elements done:

Probably going to finish it tomorrow and then adjust the code to create a simple anime game. üôÇ
